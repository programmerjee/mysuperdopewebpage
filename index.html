		<h1>My Super Dope Webpage</h1>
			<p>Hi, this is my super awesome fun webpage where the content makes no sense but there is a lot of it.  So let's get into some business that you can learn from.</p>
		<h2>This is a list of colors that are colorful in no particular order:</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>red</li>
				<li>teal</li>
				<li>purple</li>
				<li>daffodil</li>
				<li>lime green</li>
				<li>magenta</li>
				<li>atomic tangerine</li>
			</ul>
		<h2>This is a list of movies ranked from most-awesome to not-as-awesome:</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Anything with Bill Murray in it</li>
				<li>Life Aquatic</li>
				<li>Jurassic World</li>
				<li>Blade II</li>
				<li>The Matrix Sequels</li>
			</ol>
		<h2>Let's look at some images:</h2>
		<p><strong>Cats are awesome!</strong></p>	
		<p>Look at this one:</p>

		<h2>Sometimes people say important things</h2>
		<p>You need to document important things that people say so you can sound smart when it's necessary.</p>

		<h2>When it comes to HTML, there are some things you just shouldn't do.</h2>
		<p>At least, not anymore.</p>
		<br></br>
		<h3>Want bold text?</h3>
		<p>There's a <strong>right way</strong> and a <b>wrong way</b>.  Always use the <strong>right way!</strong></p>
		<h3>Maybe you need some italics?</h3>
		<p>Again, it used to be done like <i>this. This</i> is wrong.  <em>This</em> is the <em>right</em> way.</p>
		<h3>Separation of concerns</h3>
		<p>The wrong way tags above are deprecated and should not be used.  HTML should be used to mark-up or organize your content.  It should not be used to style your content or interact with it.  Those are the jobs of CSS and JavaScript!</p>
		<h2>Links</h2>
		<p>Links are one of the most important parts of the web.  They help you navigate from place to <a href="https://www.google.com"> place</a> on the Internet.</p>
